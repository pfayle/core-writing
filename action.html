<h3>Action</h3>
<p>Your choices are limited.  You either participate or you don't, and you either become informed or you don't:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue to <strong>participate in normal life without understanding,</strong> aware you are seen as the primary obstacle, trying to keep your head down or fighting blindly.</li>
<li>Play a <strong>part in experiments</strong> that can initiate change, through conversation, labour or finance, but without understanding them or endorsing any associated visions.</li>
<li>Actively <strong>endorse the status quo,</strong> defending why you do not want substantial change.</li>
<li>Position yourself to <strong>take an informed part</strong> in experiments, taking these ideas, adapting them, adding your own, and taking the lead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today's world is not a satisfactory place, and there are many things to be done in many places before it can be.  In this context, I find it possible to get asymptotically close to personal satisfaction by walking the line of how much I can do and cope with effectively while leaving enough room for others to work towards the same goals.</p>

<p>Consider how you're different to me and others.</p>
<p>If you're <strong>fundamentally different</strong> in not feeling empathy, I would recommend you choose to adopt it as a foundational value anyway and accept the need to learn about what others understand naturally.  You will often end up understanding it better &ndash; we would not be in this position if people understood their own empathy well.</p>
<p>If you're <strong>different and don't know why,</strong> I would recommend being cautious, so that you can explore until you can understand yourself, and how you would like to be accommodated, better.</p>

<blockquote>To be understood is not to be powerless.  Not to understand, is.</blockquote>

<p>If you're <strong>not different,</strong> I recommend looking for subtler and more fulfilling ways to express your individuality than exaggerating chimerical differences.  Full openness is most often impractical, but in the long run <strong>a relatable, fallible but dauntless example</strong> that people can follow is of more use than an inimitable hero.</p>

<p>Start by revisiting <a href="understanding.html">what you need to know,</a> or taking another look at <a href="experiment.html#joining">how you can participate in experiments.</a></p>
