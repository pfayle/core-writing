<h4 id="motivating-need">Motivating need</h4>
<blockquote>You don't need privilege or power to feel responsibility for the world's problems.</blockquote>
<p>The basic reason to take responsibility seriously is that other people are suffering and dying in ways that <strong>can't be dismissed</strong> as an unavoidable fact of life.</p>
<p>The authority for talking about responsibility comes from our own values (<a href="value.html">outlined later</a>), added to data about how the world is and how it works.</p>
<p>For historical and practical reasons, we have become used to relying on political and wealthy elites to make provision on our behalf for people outside our immediate family and friends.  That has deep problems, and these <strong>elites aren't good enough at it</strong> (which is not their fault), so it is not so simple to hand off our personal responsibilities.</p>

<h4 id="possibility">Possibility</h4>
<p>Igniting your sense of responsibility relies on a brighter future seeming possible.</p>
<p>There are three mental inputs to this that you have control of.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your understanding of <strong>human nature</strong> may be unduly pessimistic, or you may exaggerate the dominance of the animalistic side.</li>
<li>Your understanding of <strong>how society works</strong> may be unduly pessimistic or fixed, or you may exaggerate how a society of billions of people reduces the ability of individuals to drive major change, or you may exaggerate how much other people are against you and will obstruct you.</li>
<li>Your appreciation of <strong>your own potential</strong> may be unduly modest (as most people's is), and you may exaggerate how difficult it is for you to learn and compete.</li>
</ol>
<p>We don't have to be relentlessly positive, but <strong>finding room for hope is your first responsibility.</strong>  If you are over-confident in negativity then you won't avoid being the obstacle.</p>

<h4 id="circumstance">Dependency on circumstances</h4>
<p>Education is the elephant in the room.  There's little call to give much weight to natural cleverness except as a large initial advantage; learning is by default hard and painful, and we have a history of allowing early education to ruthlessly <strong>determine societal strata</strong> and alienate people further from the imperfect process of learning.</p>
<p>However, the increased <strong>connectedness of people to information</strong> in a wide network is providing a strong force in opposition to this.  People now have support both to undo psychological harm and to catch up in learning, <strong>given time and space.</strong></p>
<p>While catching up in a competitive sense still seems unreasonably difficult for all but the most driven of people, <strong>catching up to a certain standard</strong> &ndash; and in particular the standard to appreciate what I'm saying and to put responsibility into practice, which is also a <a href="understanding.html#competencies">competitive set of skills</a> &ndash; is now an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Historically, either we've encouraged low educational achievers not to bother catching up, but to enjoy life, leave complex responsibilities to leaders and experts, and turn up on polling day, or we've encouraged everyone to treat opinions as valuable in themselves, perhaps as a collective subconscious <strong>apology for the brutality of education.</strong>  We can still be considerately gentle, but it's not appropriate to endorse either approach widely, when refusing to settle for low educational achievement will produce far better outcomes.</p>
<p>Protecting space and time, and <strong>communicating the value</strong> to be had in investing time in learning, are the new focus.</p>

<h4 id="delegation">Inadequacy of delegation</h4>
<p>We can often trust others in their intention and goodwill but rarely in their utility, efficiency, robustness, or optimality, and often not in their competence either.  It is in this sense that role-holders and institutions are often <strong>not to blame</strong> for their overall untrustworthiness, and are <strong>not the sources of major change,</strong> as they follow the constraints of a flawed design with faulty premises.</p>
<p>You currently delegate all the time: to the government and charitable institutions in <strong>foreign aid and welfare provision;</strong> to media and academic research in <strong>analysing the world around you;</strong> to innovators and investors in <strong>keeping the world running.</strong></p>
<p>It is reasonable to have low trust in all of these delegates, but working in isolation is rarely possible.  Your best chance of meeting your responsibilities is to invest in your own understanding so that you are able to analyse how your delegates are performing and how you might change the incentives around them, through the ways in which you can interact &ndash; such as voting, donating, promoting ideas, and consuming &ndash; to improve their performance.  Though many delegates will have had a better start in life than you and often are not directly accountable, in the big picture <strong>their performance is within your control and is your responsibility.</strong></p>

<h4>Inadequacy of excuses</h4>
<p>Understanding for yourself and others is the part you play in <strong>making delegation fit for purpose.</strong></p>
<p>Only the most unfortunate people are off the hook now.  If you have time, space and your mental faculties, then putting some of them towards further learning until you are confident in your own contribution to the world is becoming mandatory.  You have the freedom and rights to choose otherwise, but it is increasingly going to affect your view of yourself and how others treat you, and learning will become the path of least resistance that gives you what you want.</p>
