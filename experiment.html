<p>The types of experiment we're talking about are thought-experiments that we can put into practice, that can start very small and scale well.  They come about from considering possibilities and applying careful intuition to the model of the world we already have.  We put them into practice both to create a large amount of experiential data and also because we have a high enough expectation that they will work well that we do not want to apply the slow caution of a scientific test.  This methodology is optimal against a time-pressured problem that we understand well, especially when there are elements that aren't particularly amenable to rigorous testing.  Overall, <strong>such experiments are precisely what the world needs right now,</strong> and at any time are the bread and butter of your individual intellectual journey.</p>

<p>There are two experiments I promote myself, described in detail later:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#protecting-time">Protect your time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#tithing">Give liberally.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The quality of a hypothesis being unknown and untested also means that <strong>the assumptions of existing modeling and projecting may not hold,</strong> so that conventional results and analytical techniques may be discountable.  Departing from many popular assumptions simultaneously can be enough to worry even the boldest of institutional funders about appearing discreditable, let alone governments, leaving these <strong>opportunities uncontested for small, informal groups of individuals.</strong>  As acknowledged in how universities are structured, for example, there has historically been an expectation that a large proportion of the best ideas begin with fresh thought and fresh thinkers.</p>

<h4 id="context">Economic context</h4>
<p>Because of the way people work, the spirit of free enterprise, competition and redistribution can be assumed to be preferable to heavy constraint and central control as a starting point for the incentive to think and work.  Attempts to implement this spirit have had mixed results to date, with central control continuing to be applied where free enterprise is seen or expected to degenerate naturally.</p>

<p>You must have substantially more than you need in order to give <em>liberally,</em> which competition enables.  If you acquire a lot more than you need, <strong>you are <em>always</em> uncertain about the opportunity cost</strong> &ndash; whether in the big picture time and money would have been put to better use without your involvement &ndash; but if everyone gave this too much consideration then no one would ever make changes.  Redistribution in some form is as sound a way to mitigate the concern as we have.</p>

<p>By competing, even when you lose utterly, <strong>you have provided the incentive to others to do what they do to a high standard</strong> &ndash; something that was often painfully and obviously absent in simple socialist experiments, reminding us that paying lip-service to an emerging ideology is insufficient and irresponsible when forecasting real behaviour.  The higher view of competition, when losers can be rewarded for providing this incentive, is one of inclusive co-operation.  It is natural for individuals to play this competitive role, and barely credible that a centrally managed system of government could replace it with an incentive of similar strength.  However, that is what we are currently being challenged to show, as authoritarian regimes through the world do find ways to produce value for their populations more safely and efficiently.</p>

<p>But this pays little attention to our limits.  Physical and mental energy are far more limited than time, and <strong>a system of competition without suitable bounds,</strong> which demands more of these energies and time than we want to give, <strong>degrades the incentives that create its success.</strong></p>

<p>So, my experiments focus on taking the reins of competition, by opening up the arena and giving individuals a bigger responsibility and ability in saying when enough is enough, and pushing hard against the <strong>current prevalence of compromise, opting out, excuse, tolerance and apology</strong> &ndash; apology for economic systems, apology for opportunities, apology for development, apology for successes.  <strong>We will address the remaining problems of competition through competition.</strong></p>

<h4 id="tithing">Giving liberally</h4>
<p>Tithing is not a new idea, but benefits from a restatement and adjustment.  Actual figures are left to individual discretion, as is the question of whether to consider wealth before or after tax, but my interpretation is as follows: I aim to give 3% of my income away as I receive it, and an additional 7% on my death in addition to parts of any underlying wealth.  These figures may rise as my lifetime income rises, and fall if I become destitute, at my discretion, though I welcome informed analyses of what might be appropriate and pragmatic.  These figures do not have lower precedence than any practical life goals, such as buying a house and providing well for children.  Coupling the total amount I give so closely to my career success, and increasing the amount I need to earn before I can fulfil my personal ambitions both provide a strong incentive for me to compete to earn more than I need or want for myself and those around me.</p>

<p>This giving away is to a high degree <em>unopinionated,</em> in that I give freely and widely, and for the most part do not account for my own political opinions as I give, with any strongly opinionated donations being made in addition and not coming from this pot.  However, it is also <em>highly planned,</em> discouraging a costly and unpleasant explosion in requests for support.  I look to hold recipients accountable where appropriate, usually through some form of delegation and collective representation.</p>

<p>Social expectation based on this incentive can only be healthy <strong>if the underlying arrangement of work is healthy</strong> &ndash; which we have clear reason to contest.</p>

<h4 id="protecting-time">Protecting time</h4>
<p>The intentions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>to preserve the benefits of competition,</li>
<li>and incentivise wider active participation,</li>
<li>by creating room for all to develop and enjoy a full range of experiences, and</li>
<li>leaving no one trapped in a predominantly menial and unfulfilling lifestyle,</li>
<li>to create an environment where trust is rational.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The primary activity is to limit the time spent working on any job to 10 hours a week.</strong>  Secondary activities are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>working several such jobs concurrently,</strong></li>
<li><strong>creating fully functional companies based on strict 10-hour weeks, and</strong></li>
<li><strong>supporting others working several such jobs concurrently.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, it is expected that this is only <strong>feasible for people with substantial financial security.</strong>  Their success will create stable opportunities for others.</p>

<p>Most jobs are dominant.  That's a pattern that can and should be broken, for everyone's benefit.</p>

<p>The primary characteristic of this dominance is <strong>control over time.</strong>  Rights to flexible working represent a very slight loss of employer control, but that is not enough to meet the desires of families, healthy people in later life, or employers.  Families want to raise children without needing to sacrifice or compensate disproportionately in their careers.  Many people beyond retirement age want to keep the particular feeling of contribution that comes from professional employment.  Employers want to be able to find, retain and invest in people who are satisfied and trustworthy.</p>

<p>The dominance is small enough when employee wealth, income and future employment outlook can easily withstand the loss of one job.  That can be achieved either by increasing those qualities individually, or by replacing a single job with multiple jobs, reducing the overall risk from any one of them.  The primary obstacle to the second option is that <strong>most people in leading and expert jobs do not protect their time</strong> and do not diversify their work in this way, so that there is little precedent, and little design work has been done on how to achieve it as an organisational norm.  This is where <strong>financially independent people in particular can create precedents, apply pressure, and shift constraints.</strong></p>

<p>The hard-working, singularly-focused person can find this counter-intuitive, but <strong>blinkered hard work is an insular and short-sighted quality that attracts personal blame for the biggest world problems.</strong>  It was likely instrumental in getting society to this point, with all its positives, but now it is single-handedly preserving a self-defeating culture that is <strong>mean-spirited when it comes to freedoms, unproductive when it comes to overall output, and unable to adapt to crises.</strong>  It is inevitable that a longer-sighted ethos would out-compete this approach.</p>

<p>There are some balances to look for.  One is the balance between frivolous dilettantism and singular-focusedness, finding the small but non-singular number of concurrent expertises and projects it is desirable to maintain.  Another is the balance between the amount of work needed for society to function, and how much time someone with complete financial freedom would like to spend working.  The final balance is between maximising personal achievement, competitiveness, wealth and luxury consumption, and making time for a fair and dutiful share in unrewarding busywork and sharing knowledge.</p>

<p>When we consider what is possible in the public sector in the next couple of decades, we either limit ourselves to the extremely unambitious or focus on better ideas being politically unworkable.  We need to move away from cultures of heroes who stretch for every short-term deadline just because they can, and think bigger than flexible working and four-day weeks.  <strong>Many more things are possible given a re-think of some long-standing assumptions by people in a position to try things out.</strong></p>

<h4 id="joining">Joining in</h4>
<p>There are several levels of joining in that help us make progress, and doing something that raises awareness is usually more important than doing something exactly right.  Some of the following suggestions should be appropriate for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think through the ideas.</li>
<li><a href="../../index.html#contact">Let me know the extent of your support and concerns.</a></li>
<li>Talk about and share the ideas with friends, in communities, with other people who are interested.</li>
<li>Advertise that you are looking for people to collaborate with.</li>
<li>Adjust your lifestyle and financial plans to create room to contribute to experiments.</li>
<li>Adjust your learning and career goals to build skills to contribute to experiments.</li>
<li>Adapt and re-publish ideas.</li>
<li>Network and facilitate financially independent people getting to know each other and working together.</li>
<li>Build new communities.</li>
<li>Encourage supportive cultures and contract terms in existing businesses.</li>
<li>Work with companies and institutions to incorporate ideas.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h4>
<p>What do we do when we don't buy into any vision, or trust no experiments?</p>

<p>We are back in the adolescent position of coming to terms with a world with very serious imperfections that trades on small successes.  They're not new imperfections, we're not expecting to clear them up quickly if at all, and there are many things that can go disastrously wrong even where we think we can make progress.  People are gloomy; the upbeat people are the ones determined not to think about the problems or to hide their true feelings.</p>

<p>You can choose between exploration, compensation, and doing nothing.</p>

<p>Exploration is how to find and design experiments.  Exploring alone is good when you think everyone else is going the wrong way and you can't stop them, or when you can't yet communicate persuasively.  Presumably few spend their whole lives in such isolation, and certainly not those who want to see change.</p>

<p>It's hard to see geographical exploration producing new options these days, and mental exploration through learning and imagining is the route of choice, still offering paths that have never been trodden.  Flying the species off the planet, while exciting, appears to fix few problems, though who knows?</p>

<p>Compensation &ndash; looking for positives to balance the negatives instead of fixing the negatives &ndash; and doing nothing are self-explanatory.  Both will attract resentment from anyone who finds hope worthwhile.</p>

<p>These considerations are orthogonal to traditional political divides.  Conservatism does not object to exploration, liberalism also cares about making changes carefully, and so on.  People are naturally well-balanced and inclined towards exploration, but people also align with the duties of care or freedoms of their single careers, and cluster around similar people.</p>

<p>Compensation and doing nothing are also the preserve of the person with great faith in the system as it is.  As a default, lazy position this will certainly attract the strongest condemnation.  As a personal position saying that your own talents don't lie in the direction of innovative thought, you would likely be irresponsibly underestimating yourself, but also be missing many of the other ways you can contribute to experimentation.  As a considered position against experimentation, it is valid to consider that social thought and discourse are finite channels, and to suggest that filling them with frivolous ideas would be wasteful and negligent, though the bar for that has been set very low to date, as we are apparently content to fill social discourse with trivialities.</p>
