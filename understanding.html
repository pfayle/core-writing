<p>I have referred to a thorough, or near-complete, understanding, or a level of learning that allows you to make informed moral choices.  <strong>This understanding supersedes a moral compass fully defined by intuitive principles.</strong>  I have claimed that such understanding is within the reach of most people, and the following is my effort to enumerate the different areas of knowledge that make up this understanding.</p>

<p>The point of this enumeration is to help de-couple your journey of acquiring knowledge, skills and awareness from my over-arching account of how we relate to the world &ndash; others will do a better job of fleshing out each area, and none of them is to be entirely relied upon, given both that the history of those expounding ideas has barely a paragraph free from gross mistakes and twisted truths, and that <strong>you will need the experience of working things out for yourself.</strong>  If someone were to re-publish this thesis in a monolithic form some day, the point would still hold &ndash; it's more helpful not to make the whole picture seem over-dependent on my own account of every smaller point.</p>

<p><strong>The final understanding is cogent, consistent, purposeful, well-informed</strong> (actively seeking out existing counter-arguments), and <strong>covering</strong> (attempting to account for all perspectives and situations) rather than complete.  Completeness should still be a goal, but one that only comes over time, and it is the right domain in which academic philosophers and psychologists may punch out the fine details, over time.</p>

<blockquote>Ongoing pursuit of this learning is what we can ask of each other.</blockquote>

<p>It is not right to be angry with people for not knowing what one cannot reasonably expect them to know, but it is reasonable to expect, from people who are not poor, for the sake of people who are: commitment, perseverance and self-criticism, given the signal that the goal is achievable.</p>

<h4 id="competency-intro">Eight competencies of thorough understanding</h4>

<p>Rather than being derived, this list is the result of breaking down what I have done differently in order to reach an understanding I can be content with, that is necessary and sufficient for making and re-making the important decisions in life every day with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>The extent to which each element is needed is left to individual discretion.  The usefulness of this list is as a point of reference for when you feel that you don't understand enough to move beyond a reliance on rules, principles and others' guidance.</p>

<p>Note that although there is a discretionary element, the list is more specific than "lifelong learning", or taking whatever lessons life throws at you, and it has an end.  As a benchmark, professional job adverts from many fields specify more requirements than are here.  Following this list from scratch is roughly equivalent in effort to choosing an ambitious career at random and succeeding in it, and I gauge it to be fully achievable by some in adolescence &ndash; never underestimate the young, who might not squander time in the same way you did.</p>

<p>Despite a focus on logic and data, which are constraining in nature, these competencies provide <strong>a strong basis for assured, free, and autonomous thought and learning,</strong> which can be applied both to fundamental life problems and across a very wide range of more specialised domains.</p>

<h5 id="competencies">The eight competencies</h5>
<ol>
<li>Follow and predict the mechanical and <strong>logical outcomes</strong> of a range of systems, from arguments to pairwise human interactions to economics, social dynamics and institutions.</li>
<li>Work carefully with <strong>quantifications</strong> in these systems, appreciating how small differences in quantity can make a difference in qualitative outcome, and how multivariate systems, including most social systems, cannot be described, predicted, or appraised effectively without quantitative awareness and confidence.</li>
<li>Be able to distinguish and appropriately work with instances of <strong>logical self-reference,</strong> inter-dependence, and circularity, distinguishing between what can be readily understood in its entirety, what is highly convoluted or chaotic, and what has no logical force.</li>
<li>Work with numerical and non-numerical concepts of <strong>uncertainty</strong> when giving advice and taking decisions.  Don't become biased by only working with what you're confident of, as some scientists do, for example, and don't let numbers over-step their meaning and hijack your intuition.</li>
<li>Maintain awareness of relevant and peripheral <strong>data.</strong>  Do not ignore exceptional information, but try to account for everything you can see, and do what you can to make what you can see representative of the whole world.  Make an effort to ensure that what you think has not already been robustly contradicted.</li>
<li>Find the final word in <strong>meaning and purpose</strong>, understand human ontology and how <a href="value.html">value</a> comes about.</li>
<li>Identify mistakes and <strong>criticise</strong> all statements and arguments accurately and automatically, and maintain awareness of your own assumptions.  Always ask what precisely is being asserted or falsified, and what the limits of the context are.</li>
<li>Preserve or return to childlikeness in <strong>imagination</strong>, not allowing it to become over-constrained by data, evidence, and existing patterns.</li>
</ol>

<p>An additional auxiliary skill that makes a big difference is to shorten and cut away unnecessary words and details, and use words precisely and succinctly, identifying the crux of a matter and not adding unnecessary complication.</p>

<h4 id="insufficient">Insufficient</h4>
<p>By contrast, while many of the following are beneficial, they are not sufficient individually or together:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rhetoric</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Hand-waving</li>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Firm principles</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Goodwill</li>
<li>Psychology</li>
<li>Data analysis</li>
<li>Belief</li>
<li>Stoicism</li>
<li>Laissez-faire</li>
<li>History/literature/art</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Manners/etiquette/politeness</li>
<li>Gravitas/dignity</li>
<li>Charisma</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>You will, however, find several of these make it easier to meet other important goals in life, which can give you a more comfortable basis to invest in the crucial skills.  Having neither the skills nor any such basis may consign you to making erratic commentary or remaining silent without reprieve, and ensuring everyone has such comfort motivates my <a href="experiment.html">experiments.</a></p>

<h4 id="example">Lack of example</h4>
<p><strong><em>No one</em> prominent in public life exhibits all eight competencies compellingly.</strong>  I have been looking for a long time, and if there was one person, I would have a role model and could point you to someone, even though the ideas in their abstraction would always be more reliable than anyone's exemplary life, and you should not need an example.  No one in my private life ever has either.  However, it's my consideration that:</p>
<ol>
<li>these two samples are not representative, and there are ample reasons why people converging on this understanding would prefer to remain obscure (though I would be grateful in the extreme if you were not to hide your brilliance), and</li>
<li>many in these two samples are close to this understanding, most are able, and the mere acts of my enumerating and signposting are the only external impetus that should be needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Redundantly, to become a world-leading psychologist, teacher, scientist, lawyer, academic, author, trader, commentator, cleric, or company director you do not require the eight competencies.  Indeed, such fellows who combine an incapability in more general fields with a disdain for those with still less understanding are easily found, and the potential of their idle example to spread to others is vexatious in the extreme.  While I don't think it's helpful to encourage humility, the path to eminence is substantially disjoint from the path to understanding, but understanding is now available to many who would never be eminent.</p>

<h4 id="importance">Importance</h4>
<p>It is important that enough individuals converge on understanding so that it becomes clear that this is possible and desirable, and so that discourse can move away from over-simplifications that demean us and cause us to fail each others' needs.  It is not reasonable to expect to achieve these societal benefits by dividing and conquering &ndash; <strong>all core competencies need to be present in each individual.</strong>  Most often, it is mistakes &ndash; rather than difficulty &ndash; that stand in the way, with most people persisting in making critical mistakes in one or more areas, and society-backed simplistic principles reinforcing that persistence.</p>

<blockquote>To pursue understanding is to take ownership of your moral responsibility.</blockquote>
<p>Failure to understand does two things.  One, it leaves your judgement narrow and inaccurate, which is particularly pronounced with a strong adherence to a small set of moral principles.  Two, it makes you available to amplify other people's judgements, explicitly or tacitly.  This second has historically been a key factor in the rise to power of individuals who either make unforced errors of judgement at a higher rate, or think and feel in fundamentally different ways to almost all of us.  There may always be high-functioning individuals who are sociopathic by nature, for instance, and from local management, to organised crime, to the subversion of individual protections, to the use of weapons of mass destruction, it is in your interests not to play a part in making power and opportunity available to them, and sometimes you will be the only effective check.</p>

<blockquote>People with understanding have great potential together.</blockquote>
<p>No amount of principle will substitute for this understanding, and it is wide adoption of said understanding that opens the door to bigger societal changes, in part by enabling simplicity and less rigidity in a society where people are more satisfied and amenable.</p>

<h4 id="learning-paths">Learning paths</h4>

<p>For guidance, the best I can do is attempt to deconstruct my own journey into general parts &ndash; below &ndash; to make it possible to replicate the journey without needing the same opportunities or my intuition.  There may of course be alternative routes.</p>

<blockquote>If you can't explain something simply, it might be fundamentally complicated.</blockquote>
<p>What is optimal for your own understanding is likely not optimal for communicating ideas to other people.  The response to this is to treat understanding and communicating as two separate activities, and to require charity and responsibility from your audience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Criticise everything.  Be fair, but try to find all the holes and gauge which are biggest.</li>
<li>Without being mean-spirited or jealous, look for faults in the most popular ideas and people of your time, or clarify the scope in which they deserve to be popular.</li>
<li>Construct arguments in a system that has a formal concept of rigour, such as maths, logic, or law.</li>
<li>Specialise in some complex system, but don't anchor your way of thinking to it.</li>
<li>Consider the incentives and mechanics of compromises.</li>
<li>Keep aware of events in the real world.</li>
<li>Keep trying to account for 100% of other people's behaviour, in detail.  Never write behaviour off as stupid, but get to know when decisions are simply arbitrary and won't benefit from further analysis.</li>
<li>Look for appropriate language to work efficiently and accurately with ideas.  Investment in precision and attention to detail can be very time-efficient in the long-run, even if it can't be used in communication to a non-specialist audience.</li>
<li>Look for abstract understanding, because this helps you faster understand systems analogous to ones you already know.</li>
<li>Keep asking "why" until you get to some fundamental property of the world or a person, like a fundamental choice.  Where you don't know, speculate and follow each possibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an imbalance as to which education and qualification paths give you more of these opportunities without additional effort.  That is natural, as social systems are not committed, currently, to handing you any of the understanding competencies on a plate.  Sometimes commercial interests are incentivised to be more appreciative of some competencies than artistic, intellectual and voluntary interests, and can produce more focused and efficient learning-paths; sometimes it's the other way around; sometimes walks of life are incentivised to work directly against some competencies, which is where <strong>you need to be careful about deriving identity and self-worth from your activities.</strong></p>

<p>Insights come more naturally from different walks of life, and sometimes it's better to meander through different groups of people and opportunities when insight proves hard to find.  While the right subject choice can help a great deal (abstract maths gets you started with some of the least common competencies, for example), and although it would be time-efficient to wrap life skills and career skills into the same comprehensive curriculum, we're a long way from that now, and we should expect to invest separately in our general understanding.</p>

<h4 id="respect">Respect</h4>
<p>This will always be a substantial mental journey, even when better precedent and social support make the going easier and simpler, and for as long as people are still being born and growing up, there will be people in earlier stages of the journey, whose needs while learning it makes sense to protect.  Respect being a way to signal what is important and valuable and worth protecting in society and individual relationships, serving as a basis for trust and healthy interactions, there is a distinction to be made defining where respect can be counter-productive, but also difficulty and hurt in transitioning away from an attitude of respect by default for others' principle-based views.</p>

<p>My suggested approach is to offer respect for people's experience, choices and holistic opinions, and even persistent and obvious mistakes made in this good faith, but only tolerance to other opinions derived more narrowly, treating <strong>a deep commitment to learning as a necessary component of trustworthy integrity.</strong></p>

<p>Where feigning respect is constructive to learning, then so be it, but allowing such false signals to pervade social discourse seems unnecessary.</p>
