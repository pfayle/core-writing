<p>These questions are provided as a quick reflection of some key parts of the core narrative.</p>

<dl>
<dt id="wrong">What's wrong?</dt>
<dd>A quick inquiry about the state of the world shows severe inadequacy and confusion.</dd>

<dt id="inadequate">What's severely inadequate?</dt>
<dd>Large populations suffering severe hunger and physical and mental pain;</dd>
<dd>high uncertainty, a lack of agreement among experts and leaders, a lack of robustness, and a lack of clear recent and expected progress.</dd>

<dt id="best">Isn't this the best or nearly the best we can do?</dt>
<dd>No. It is easy to be naive or over-optimistic about the state and the direction of travel, particularly if you are working hard.</dd>

<dt id="more">Surely you can't ask more of me?</dt>
<dd>Yes.  Hard-working, normal individuals accepting their place and the state of the world are a key part of the problem and the first thing that needs to change.</dd>
<dd>As if that wasn't difficult enough to stomach, it is particularly true for individuals working hard to alleviate some part of the problem.  <strong>Not only is your goodwill not enough; it adds to, exacerbates, and prolongs the problem unless you do more.</strong>  While we may have become very dependent on you, you need to take back control.</dd>

<dt id="how">How can <em>you</em> ask more of me?</dt>
<dd>I have taken on risk and pain in order to inform myself and play a part I consider appropriate, and I expect the same of you.</dd>
<dd>I don't think my advantages or differences justify me accommodating inaction on your part, or render me unable to appreciate your situation.</dd>
<dd>Everyone would be asking more of you; I just have the higher confidence in the reasoning.</dd>
<dd>Your life choices are everyone's business, and <strong>the limiting factor</strong> in fixing unacceptable problems.</dd>

<dt id="what">What are you asking of me?</dt>
<dd>Invest in a <a href="understanding.html">precise kind of understanding.</a></dd>
<dd>Work towards taking some part in <a href="experiment.html">experiments.</a></dd>

<dt id="motive">Why are you writing?</dt>
<dd>I have a <strong>thorough and accurate <a href="understanding.html">understanding</a></strong> of the whole picture, and a way of <strong>conveying it efficiently</strong> that could make a big difference, which I don't see being done or likely to be done elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>I also want to give the people who know me a way to understand my motivation better,</dd>
<dd>and to make myself a conduit for like-minded people.</dd>

<dt id="okay">Why would you think my understanding is inadequate?</dt>
<dd>Because your understanding was built on the foundations of existing social structures, education, work and literature, that force an assumption that we're already <strong>doing well enough as a society</strong> in the big picture,</dd>
<dd>because social success depends heavily on endorsing such structures,</dd>
<dd>because the analyses you make are framed by lazy assumptions that I don't share and the consequent justifications for your life choices are weak,</dd>
<dd>and because even if you've moved beyond this, you haven't published a plan to do better.</dd>

<dt id="better">Can you do substantially better?</dt>
<dd>Yes.  The changes and <a href="experiment.html">experiments</a> I recommend and the <a href="vision.html">vision</a> I outline are credible, and now need people to put them into practice.</dd>

<dt id="alternatives">What alternatives are there to your opinions?</dt>
<dd>Today, none widely known that address my concerns &ndash; this was a pre-condition for me writing.  My aim is to provide a sufficient basis for you to be satisfied with how you address those concerns, the basis being readily attainable regardless of how challenging it is.</dd>
<dd>A focus on abstraction and logic, combined with meticulous introspection, leaves little room for understandings that are compatible but different.</dd>
<dd>Esoteric religious beliefs can re-order your values and understanding of the world, invalidating most of my writing and putting you at odds with others' basic needs &ndash; care is advised.</dd>
<dd>There is scope for medical science and mental exploration to suggest more precise ways to express the results of my introspection, explaining how my mind interacts with choice, emotion and value.</dd>
<dd>There is <a href="experiment.html#alternatives">scope for alternative experiments, speculation and visions.</a></dd>

<dt id="understand">Am I supposed to understand what you're saying?</dt>
<dd>If you don't already understand, I am saying the moral decision is usually for you to <a href="understanding.html">change this,</a> and you can't rely entirely on other people understanding and making choices on your behalf.</dd>
<dd>It's not always a short journey, creating opportunity for learning and learning itself can be hard.</dd>
<dd>Look to become independent, ask for help when you want it, and use my <a href="understanding.html#competencies">pointers</a> to keep track of where you're going.</dd>
<dd>Ask anyone who claims to understand better how they deal with suffering.  It is <a href="value.html">important,</a> your contribution and learning make a difference, whoever you are, and your inaction and poor understanding are not harmless.</dd>

<dt id="credibility">Where does credibility come from?</dt>
<dd>Ideas themselves,</dd>
<dd>auxiliary skills of criticism and logical and measured reasoning,</dd>
<dd>contextual awareness and realism,</dd>
<dd>few conflicts of interest,</dd>
<dd>lack of coercive tone and language,</dd>
<dd>and lack of contrary evidence.</dd>

<dt id="long">Why don't you need a longer form?</dt>
<dd>Because I have a high level of confidence that a complete treatment <strong>could not contradict</strong> what I have written.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, taking no responsibility for the reader's readiness and attitude helps avoid duplicating effort.</dd>
<dd>I have committed to keeping the core exposition below 15,000 words.</dd>
<dd>I am not paid by the word.</dd>

<dt id="few">Why do you only have two <a href="experiment.html">experiments?</a></dt>
<dd>Because I expect them to produce <a href="vision.html">a massive shift</a> by themselves,</dd>
<dd>and make large inroads into all the unacceptable problems.</dd>
<dd>When the dust of change starts to settle will be the time for more experiments.</dd>

<dt id="current">What role does this have in the current or future crisis?</dt>
<dd>That depends on the speed of adoption.</dd>
<dd>The underlying problems addressed persist between crises, though may be exacerbated by them.</dd>
<dd>This work supposes that the current or future crisis does not destabilise the social structures required for experiments.</dd>
<dd>The <a href="value.html#core">understanding of human value</a> remains relevant through all time.</dd>

<dt id="references">Why don't you include references?</dt>
<dd>Because it's unnecessary,</dd>
<dd>I don't want to dilute my own credibility by implying a level of trust and respect that doesn't exist,</dd>
<dd>I don't want to endorse academic processes in their current forms,</dd>
<dd>and I don't want to suggest that wide reading is either necessary or optimal for thorough understanding.</dd>

<dt id="behind">What work have you done behind the scenes?</dt>
<dd>I have developed my ideas without high exposure to or investment in literary, historical, psychological and philosophical canons, and without collaboration.</dd>
<dd>I have worked in detail with detached, abstract, logical systems, through maths and engineering,</dd>
<dd>and after development I have tested the ideas against the aforementioned canons using encyclopaedic and secondary sources only, and against real world situations using personal experience, conversations, news media, and literature, over a period of years.</dd>

<dt id="future">What will you be doing in the future?</dt>
<dd>I do not have higher expectations of myself than of you.</dd>
<dd>This text is the extent of my planned exceptional work.</dd>
<dd>I expect to be factoring my experiments into a normal life,</dd>
<dd>attempting to live exemplarily in a compromised world without exasperation,</dd>
<dd>looking to find people who want to experiment together,</dd>
<dd>helping people to learn the simpler things,</dd>
<dd>and helping people who want to work with these ideas.</dd>

<dt id="criticism">How will you handle robust criticism?</dt>
<dd>I don't carry more responsibility for this than you, and I provide no guarantee that I will maintain or consistently express and defend a superior understanding of the whole.</dd>
<dd>Circumstances willing, I will track criticism and publish changes I consider appropriate, openly.</dd>
<dd>Circumstances failing or in any case, anyone has free licence to adopt, adapt and re-publish this work.</dd>

<dt id="error">What if you're wrong?</dt>
<dd>I will retract or amend if anyone communicates errors to me effectively, or I become aware of them.</dd>
<dd>The structure and nature of my work provide robustness of the conclusions against many types of error, providing me with high confidence.</dd>
<dd>The reader should be or become competent to identify or handle minor errors.</dd>
<dd>I have tested the ideas to my own satisfaction.</dd>

<dt id="action">What should I do?</dt>
<dd>Read through what I have to say,</dd>
<dd>about the <a href="experiment.html">experiments</a> I have designed,</dd>
<dd>and the <a href="action.html">actions</a> available to you.</dd>
<dd>Continue at the very least to think and talk,</dd>
<dd>and improve my solution if you can,</dd>
<dd>but <strong>take personal responsibility for changing the world.</strong></dd>
