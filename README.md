# Core writing

This repository exists to record and track changes to my core, maintained writing.

Maintenance is intended but no standards or processes are envisaged.  There is no policy for managing GitHub issues, which may be raised freely to communicate concerns and feedback publicly.

As per the root document, the text in this repository may be used for any purpose without attribution.

For any copy to comply with the original intention and spirit, the total word count of the published documents here should remain below 15,000 words.

The canonical version of this text will be published at peterfayle.com/writing/core/
