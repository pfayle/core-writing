<p>Everything here I see as the eventual consequence of the understanding and experimental changes I've outlined.  That is, although I'm not drawing out or substantiating each point, nothing is stated here without detailed consideration of how it would come about and fit with the other moving parts.  Additionally, none of it relies on "technological" progress other than the improvement of education and learning, and minor restructurings of social organisation.  While this is the place for optimism to be unfettered, this is more substantial and structured than idle speculation.</p>

<blockquote>Empowering people to pursue their own satisfaction changes their behaviour.</blockquote>
<p>The most important premise to keep in mind is that not only are almost no individuals exclusively self-prioritising by nature, which society already relies upon, but people are satisfiable and become decreasingly self-prioritising as they become secure and satisfied, which is what both enables social change and allows a better society to be robust.  It is easy to forget this because <strong>our entire history has been characterised by the normalisation of severe deprivation and constraint.</strong></p>

<p>To make <em>eventual consequence</em> a little less vague: it's difficult to support a vision unless you can foresee major differences well within two generations, and longer-term visions are omitted here.  Projections existing at the time of writing should be ignored in this context, as underlying models assume no major shift in individual behaviours (modellers and forecasters aren't incentivised to be this speculative, but you should be).</p>

<blockquote>Take this seriously to give your children a better life.</blockquote>
<p>For every point, <strong>substantial progress within the current generation is desired</strong> and not ruled out.  Given what is currently systemically unacceptable, you should <strong>hold each other individually responsible,</strong> as I do, for removing your objections to change and ensuring that this comes to pass within your lifetime and does not drag on for decade after decade.</p>

<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>It will not come about immediately, and direct introduction may fail badly and repeatedly in the coming years, but <strong>a guaranteed minimal income that covers a baseline is a natural end.</strong>  Incentive to work will come from the understanding and acceptance of social contribution, a slightly altered structure that's fair enough to be satisfying, and the realisation and availability of work that is substantially rewarding in itself in ways that aren't easy to replace.</p>

<p>Supporting this, normal working patterns will be structured so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remaining manual <strong>unambitious/unpleasant/menial work is shared,</strong> and not the hallmark of a subdued, economically dominated class.  You may even find such things as a lawyer working hands-on in an abattoir for a small number of hours a week, in the name of service and perspective.</li>
<li>Changing your career focus is smooth and not blocked by "life getting in the way".  You can pivot many times to find your places of best contribution and fulfilment.</li>
<li>Most people have <strong>more than one ambitious career,</strong> concurrently.</li>
<li>No working relationship is a single point of severe failure.</li>
<li>Transferable ideas and practices find their way quickly between different worlds of work and thought.</li>
</ul>

<p>Restructured work will compensate for the loss of direct and exclusive or dominant power over individual employees and the bulk of their time, and the risk of relying more on people who are less dependent, through effective processes that can rely on most individuals being more ambitious for themselves and the success of their companies.  Expect this to have a <strong>net positive effect on productivity</strong> in almost all businesses.</p>

<blockquote>Freedom and time herald a new generation of innovation.</blockquote>
<p>Better control over time and direction will see individuals forming voluntary and less formal initiatives more often, but overall there will be an increased desire for these to either morph promptly into formal, funded arrangements, or remain very small and experimental (avoiding taking advantage of unpaid work).  It will be <strong>easier to find people to work on speculative side-projects</strong> on a structured and ongoing basis, and this will be a key contributor to a culture of innovation.</p>

<p>A lower level of reliance on individual employers, together with a social safety net with fewer conditions attached, will promote individuals feeling able to pursue and fight for the particular achievements, opportunities and luxuries they want.</p>

<p>Normalisation of low hours will lead to <strong>increased job-sharing,</strong> with advanced communication and hand-over skills becoming common and standardised.</p>

<p><strong>Expect lines to blur further</strong> between business, art, academia, government, and education, among others.</p>

<p>Hybrid individual working arrangements, between full-time contracts and freelancing, fixed and fluid work-networks, will become normal.</p>

<blockquote>You'll have enough money, but you won't want to retire.</blockquote>
<p>Retirement will also become blurred and vague &ndash; there may still be a nominal age by which no further attempts at work are expected, but it will be normal to work low hours regularly beyond this age, and companies staffed predominantly by such retirees paid as normal will be very successful.  This will be stable because <strong>much more work will have become enjoyable and rewarding,</strong> enough to compete against the attractions of even greater freedom, spontaneity and rest.  Declining health will be accounted for with less reference to age.</p>

<p><strong>Individual jobs will play a reduced role in how we identify and characterise people,</strong> partly because people will do more different jobs on average both over their lifetimes and simultaneously.</p>

<p>Working continuously with a single focus will be effectively limited to people with a <strong>true and peculiar vocation,</strong> but others with vocations will find that broadening their activities is a more effective path to realising them.  Taking most people away from single expertises will <strong>promote higher levels of trust in expertise</strong> socially.</p>

<p>Competition will continue to play a major role in overall productivity.  <strong>Setting bounds to competition through social norms</strong> about how we spend time and how we spread and share risk will keep the function healthy for individuals and productivity.</p>

<p>Lower normal hours will <strong>reduce the cost and risk of hiring</strong> and investing in people, making transition from education and rehabilitation easier for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>Personally, I dream of the <strong>lottery winner</strong> and <strong>successful entrepreneur</strong> and <strong>freelancer</strong> who keep working alongside their second families in the <strong>corporate office,</strong> the <strong>painter who manages police detectives,</strong> the <strong>surgeon teaching children about literature,</strong> the <strong>accountant who cleans the village's windows,</strong> the <strong>architect who cooks in a restaurant,</strong> the <strong>90-year old electrician who still works two hours a day,</strong> and the <strong><em>jazz-pianist</em> slash <em>funeral-director</em> slash <em>game-developer</em> slash <em>bank-clerk.</em></strong>  None of these are voluntary jobs, or temporary, or frivolous, and the weekends are still free &ndash; it is normal.</blockquote>

<h4 id="family">Family</h4>

<blockquote>Equality questions will mostly evaporate.</blockquote>
<p>The impact of family on career will be equivalent to taking the same time out for any other reason.  More general career-breaks will become more common, and <strong>returning to work easier</strong> for employees and employers, <strong>with the normalisation of low-hour work.</strong>  Sex and gender will disappear as significant factors without additional action.</p>

<p>The impact of domestic tasks on overall time available will be widely realised, in addition to its consequences for other activities and life goals.  Domestic tasks will be distributed more evenly initially, before demand for domestic services rises.  Because of the changes in the practicalities of work, domestic and other auxiliary services will not be strong symbols of low economic status or power, but will likely continue to be competitively priced.  These considerations may also lead to changes in the preferred design of living spaces and living arrangements, with a <strong>continuing demand for private space,</strong> but the focus of everyday life shifting outside the home and permitting smaller home spaces that are easier to maintain.</p>

<p>The average reproduction rate in developed countries will <strong>increase to the natural replacement rate</strong> (one child per adult), except under explicit and co-ordinated global policy when control over population size is desired, when individual discretion will continue to play a large part.  People will continue to make use of traditional and new family structures to bring up healthy children, as well as a wider range of emerging services, and wider society will continue to have a role of control and responsibility in all such processes.</p>

<h4 id="individuality">Individuality &amp; culture</h4>
<p>There will, overall, be a lower emphasis on personal identity as something of core importance that needs protecting, except in its most intense hormonal and animalistic manifestations, largely because natural protections will generally be adequate, but also as effective social contribution provides the satisfaction of core values that <strong>we currently look to personality to compensate</strong> for.  However, it will naturally continue to be the case that personal expression will play a major role in the execution of that contribution, with no reason why it wouldn't or shouldn't.</p>

<p>This will extend to culture at social, ethnic, religious, workplace, and national levels.  People will continue to enjoy and derive value from these cultures, and freedoms and ways of life will continue to be spread and defended, but the relative importance or centrality of any individual culture will appear reduced.  <strong>Ideas of core moral relativism will subside,</strong> core legal principles will not provide extensive support for behaviour driven by unshared beliefs, and a pragmatism arising from the acknowledged shared core of values, previously thought missing or misunderstood, will provide for a common interface between ways of life.</p>

<p>Individual enjoyment and fulfilment will come primarily from a mixture of engaging work, side-projects, passive hobbies and one-off activities, interactions with a range of people over long-term relationships, and a sense of responsibility and contribution.  <strong>Culture will often play a meaningful, decorative, valued role</strong> in all of these.</p>

<h4 id="local-politics">Local politics</h4>
<p>The scope of politics at every level will be slightly adjusted to fit the basis that individuals really do have informed responsibility and the capacity to discharge it effectively, and general practice will be only to delegate on the basis of time-efficiency and the need for collective decision-making.</p>

<p>Some collective decisions will move to an <strong>aggregate quantified basis,</strong> while other representative authority will remain with a delegated individual or group.  Determinations will be made according to whether an aggregate constitutes a sensible and strategically sound compromise, and whether the relevant electorate is likely to be well-informed on the decision by the time of polling, which will be a matter of time, interest, and access to information, and not a matter of intelligence and ability.</p>

<p>Assembly and protest will continue to be mechanisms used to signal dissatisfaction with representatives and their decisions or other behaviour, or strength of feeling and urgency of a current issue.</p>

<p>A democratic electorate will be aware of the international onus on them to <strong>demonstrate that respecting and protecting individual freedoms leads to a healthy, productive, and robust social structure.</strong></p>

<p>As individual responsibility is allowed to play a more active and free part in society and people are more at peace with themselves, <strong>disdain for humanity and leaders will decrease,</strong> which will put heavy pressure on organised crime, forcing it to change how it operates and shrinking it.  More generally, it will be more difficult to maintain a counter-culture against a society with fewer problems.</p>

<h4 id="global-politics">Global politics</h4>
<p>There will be a global ability to <strong>respond decisively and promptly to the most urgent threats,</strong> without necessarily having access to full information, and <strong>without necessarily having any consensus</strong> across non-executive expert communities.  This ability will never be within the power of a very small number of people, and its use will come with a highly consequential level of public visibility and accountability after the fact.  Overall, the historical concerns about abuses of power will have mostly evaporated, but it will remain <strong>crucial to be robust against the behaviours of the rare people</strong> who fundamentally do not behave as we expect them to.</p>

<blockquote>States will combine through mergers.</blockquote>
<p>The number of individual nation states will decrease over time through mergers.  These will have become feasible because the <strong>shift in perspective on culture makes a change in sovereignty conceivably palatable.</strong>  Supporting secession in the international community may prove an effective way to force governmental structures to remain efficient and representative, but secession on the grounds of local differences in economic performance will generally be considered spurious.  Mergers, despite the grander ambitions of political visionaries, will each involve only two or three states, since they will be difficult to negotiate and difficult to carry out.  The combined effect will be highly devolved states that preserve historical social cultures while facilitating the strong executive power required to remain globally competitive and address global issues.</p>

<p>Global aid will become decoupled from government, being driven primarily by voluntary contributions from individuals.  The effect of this is to <strong>strengthen person-to-person bonds between countries,</strong> which assists with the current objection that aid creates leverage for the donor country.  In the long run, there are two interesting possibilities to consider.  One, in the dramatic and unexpected event of a reversal of economic fortunes, the brotherly arrangement could reverse without the need for drawn-out political manoeuvres.  Two, as poorer countries develop and the need for aid reduces, the funding pool can naturally be repurposed to increase global minimal income.</p>

<blockquote>Freedom of movement cannot be fundamental in a globalised world.</blockquote>
<p>As we move further in the direction of a single global jurisdiction, freedom of movement may be limited.  For example, travel and relocation may be partially restricted long-term in the interests of environmental, economic, or epidemiological protection.  The impact of this is offset since individuals have a <strong>reduced need to find compensatory value in regular, distant travel,</strong> due to the improvements in lifestyle offered by working arrangements.  As ever, the human treatment of refugees will take a high priority in any such restrictive arrangement.</p>

<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p>Both extremes of initial circumstances will be well catered for, with ample opportunity for anyone to move to better-fitting paths to build early confidence, and to re-trace missed steps later, and with people who pick things up easily not held back.</p>

<blockquote>The majority of graduates will soon be fundamentally competent in a way that no-one is today.</blockquote>

<p>Either school curricula or cultural upbringing will cater for thorough understanding, with the aim of a significant proportion of school-leavers already proficient across <a href="understanding.html#competencies">all competencies.</a></p>

<p>All young people will have regular access to, and learning relationships with, <strong>successful, fulfilled and inspirational people</strong> from a full range of walks of life, and schooling will be organised to support teachers having ambitious additional careers, with teaching as a full-time vocation becoming much rarer.</p>

<p>Local communities dedicated to learning together will either coordinate learning content and progression, or provide support and structure.  This will become an effective and popular entry-point into a large lifelong learning industry that supports the different needs of career-builders, amateur hobbyists, and dilettantes.  Continued commitment to building skills and learning will be common and well-supported by working arrangements.  <strong>Individuals at most points in life will be active in some form of planned learning.</strong></p>

<h4 id="value">Value</h4>
<p>Although <strong>a capitalist, consumerist mentality will remain ubiquitous,</strong> services will become a more popular form of luxury purchase than physical objects, and the utility of status symbols will be reduced.  Consciousness of the total lifecycle costs of consumption will be high, and <strong>mature analyses of these impacts and global affordability</strong> will be available routinely during a purchase.  Physical objects and their crafting will however continue to form a very visible and distinctive part of everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>Luxury will be enjoyed more for its own sake</strong> than to compensate for a heavily burdened daily life, which will be particularly visible in attitudes to travel and holidays.  Addictions will be uncommon, because each individual places a high value on control, and has social support to make that easier.</p>

<blockquote>Capitalism will redeem itself.</blockquote>

<p>The centrality of fair exchange, with fairness governed by practical factors rather than emotive ones, will be better accepted in a capitalist system not so tainted by massive systemic failures.  <strong>Working for free will not be common,</strong> and it will be hard to justify it as fighting for a very different alternative.</p>

<blockquote>The main contributor to mental health problems will evaporate.</blockquote>

<p>Mental health will be buttressed by a clear sense of value through a clear set of current and potential roles and contributions to a clearly improving society, with all the big threats to livelihood and future potential fully negated by changes to work.  We will no longer conspire to deceive ourselves about societal progress.  We will feel no guilt about bringing children into the world.</p>

<h4 id="research">Research &amp; advancement</h4>

<blockquote>Focused specialists will struggle to compete.</blockquote>

<p>In most areas, organised individuals spreading their time across several interests will begin to out-compete more concentrated experts, with an optimal balance for productivity and learning being generally found somewhere between dilettantism and a singular focus.  With post-retirement generations encouraged to remain mentally active and socially engaged after employment, expect <strong>amateur hobbyists to play a more engaged role in research</strong> communities.</p>

<blockquote>The commercial university is dead.</blockquote>

<p>Universities will either win protection as cultural institutions or change their ways of working beyond recognition, with practical considerations forcing different subject areas to be treated very differently.  The bulk of <strong>ideation will come from people with more diverse areas of interest,</strong> and from the larger networks of specialists made available by employing people on lower hours.  The research process beyond ideation will often be highly standardisable, amenable to adopting improvements more directly from business and more accessible to non-academic specialists.  Such ways of working may mean that formal academia acts as a less aggressive funnel and filter, with fewer people leaving the profession entirely, focusing on self-preservation, curtailing their other ambitions, or settling for a lower potential, the hallmarks of pathological competition that are desirable in no profession.</p>

<blockquote>Intellectual property remains unsolvable in the general case.</blockquote>

<p>The legal protection of ideas will remain practically impossible for new entrants in many areas.  The increased freedom of work will see small companies forming without the intention of making a profit or paying large salaries, but solely in order to move the state of an industry forward <strong>where large incumbents are sluggish.</strong>  While this model will not generally be encouraged, it will facilitate innovation and disruption in industries with low profit-margins where incumbents cannot or will not fund substantial research.</p>

<blockquote>Demand for innovation will have peaked.</blockquote>

<p>As global poverty reduces to the point where it can be managed effectively by local communities, support for innovation will reach a plateau before falling, and overall working hours too.  <strong>People will not care as much</strong> about either increased luxury or combating extinction risks <strong>as they did about absolute poverty,</strong> but the popularity of medical research will continue, as will the focus on efficiency and automation.  People may continue working and consuming innovative luxury services solely to support the economic model that drives this efficient research, but there will be questions about whether an alternative model could reduce waste while continuing to provide security.</p>

<h4 id="diversity">Diversity &amp; opportunity</h4>
<blockquote>We capitalise on natural advantages instead of levelling everything, and we forget no one.</blockquote>
<p>Governments will <strong>optimise for large scale outcomes subject to achieving a minimum standard</strong> for every individual.  In normal times, that minimum standard will mostly rise over time, and governments will be increasingly open about this guiding principle.</p>

<p>Where there is provision for equal opportunities, it will be based on long-term potential.  This includes rectifying any statistical differences that can be attributed to current and previous social systems within one's responsibility.  It will not be a wasteful attempt to level the vicissitudes of fate and distribute our burdens evenly.</p>

<p>With global poverty reduced, and growth and competition at more of a distance from basic subsistence, the relationship between <strong>collective productivity and responsibility will relax,</strong> and this will reduce any remaining data-driven incentives and pressures to discriminate.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>We will have transitioned successfully from a <strong>system that was dependent on holding back</strong> competition's maleficiaries from developing and contributing, but we will have <strong>retained the benefits of fierce competition.</strong>  The widespread improvements &ndash; the productivity and satisfaction in particular &ndash; will make maintaining the system's stability much simpler than the transition or the present.</p>
