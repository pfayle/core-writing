<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>I write about things important enough to put immediate and lasting onus on you to consider them, because it's <strong>you who needs to change the world,</strong> and you who thinks it's not good enough.</p>

<p>This text provides my advice on how you achieve this change through personal commitment to learning and experimentation, and accounts for why freedom's not enough for you, and why other people don't respect and sometimes don't tolerate your opinions, why they're reasonable not to, why <strong>your moral standing is considerably weaker</strong> than you might think, and how other people are able to see this.  Whether you're doing nothing, putting your efforts towards some major but ultimately marginal issue, or taking on a traditional leadership role, you will need to engage with criticism and acknowledge what is inadequate, compromised and detrimental about these positions &ndash; something we all have to come to terms with, currently &ndash; before fully appreciating what I am trying to do.  If you want to save this for later, then skip ahead to the <a href="experiment.html">experiments</a> or the <a href="vision.html">vision.</a></p>

<p>I see this as putting together what many people understand intuitively, but in the intuitive understanding the individual pieces unconnected are frustratingly inadequate, and it is too easy to repeat common mistakes over and over again.  It is a much-needed patching-up of existential thought and moral philosophy, with tangible consequences for normal people, and committed to avoiding the level of detail, use of over-specialised language, and sheer length that are often assumed to make credible treatment of these domains <strong>inaccessible to the layman.</strong></p>

<blockquote>The reader is required to employ a high degree of responsibility and charity.</blockquote>
<p>I write about things that can be followed and applied if you regularly have discretion over how you spend some of your time, access to information, and the opportunity to challenge yourself.  Beyond this, I make no qualitative distinctions dependent on your perspective, what you believe, or the size of your talents, abilities, and other wealth, and I leave it to your individual discretion to determine appropriate quantitative distinctions, but in a very general sense consider every one of you equally, and significantly, responsible.  In your reading, the appropriately charitable approach is for you to <strong>assume by default that your perspective is not completely alien to me,</strong> that I have already given both it and you effective consideration through either sympathy or imagination, and that I am familiar with widely-known data that might be considered evidential (responsibility for familiarity with and evaluation of such data lies entirely with the reader, as it will not be signposted or included here).  There are many walks of life and types of marginalisation that I have not forgotten.  Where this assumption becomes impossible for you to sustain, I will be glad to hear of your experience.</p>

<p>As witnessed by a long and verbose academic history, it is possible to discuss many/most aspects of this content ad infinitum.  My opinion is that it is possible to achieve a short exposition that provides a sufficiently accurate and explicit basis for a framework for understanding and reasoning about all life's complexities, full control of which remaining within the intellectual means of a non-expert individual (perhaps often not within the reach of someone's current understanding, but no more than an infrequent look-up or train of thought away).  Consequently, I present here a series of outlines of my own thought forming a continuous narrative, from observations, through desires and expectations, and ending with actions.</p>

<h4 id="introductory-statement">Introductory statement</h4>
<p>Over the course of our early lives, we change quickly through multiple paradigms of interaction with the world and decision-making, before getting stuck.  Starting with physical instincts, we form physical habits and rules, and later mental ones too.  From there, pattern-recognition and story-telling, reason and communication allow us to derive, adopt, adapt and apply principles.  As it becomes apparent that the intuitive process of selecting and refining principles can develop in many ways, and produces very different results for different people, our problem begins with how we handle this.</p>

<p>There are three mainstream approaches to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume that there is no truth or value, and that principles may be freely used and discarded nihilistically;</li>
<li>Assume that truth and value depend on individual perspective and experience, and that there are no universals, leading to some sort of moral relativity;</li>
<li>Assume that truth and value are singular but practically inaccessible and/or incommunicable, and that non-analytical resolutions of conflicts between multiple principle-led groups are the most practical approach to social order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rejecting all of these, <strong>my main thesis is that no consistent, principle-led approach can be a sufficient exercise of our individual or collective responsibility, but that that does not translate into ambiguity, and we need to work and communicate instead from a basis of a more thorough understanding.</strong>  Further, the use of any principle-based system in social discourse should be seen as overly reductive by default, and though it may remain the most appropriate paradigm for all intermediate learning and decision-making, it is to be deliberately avoided in public discourse about any substantial matter.</p>

<h4 id="potential">Potential</h4>
<p>Through recent technological progress around the availability of information and education, you've had another boost to your potential &ndash; you can now make quantitative judgements about the state of the world and what you can and should do about it by relying on external agencies only for data, rather than data and analyses.  Few had this before.</p>

<p>That's good, because all the trust mechanisms we're used to are terribly brittle and it's usually impossible to determine failures and abuses of trust accurately, while reasons for such degradations are ubiquitous.</p>

<p>In particular, relying on experts and institutions for any but the narrowest of judgements is so vulnerable today that it's an irresponsible approach for most people to take.  I write at a time when the scientific community is highly compromised, political leadership is highly constrained, and literature and moral guidance are riddled with long-lived errors, confused and misleading; and it is to independent individuals such as yourself that we should look to break the deadlocks.</p>

<p>More of you also have the potential to fully reverse any misfortune or missed opportunities from your early education.  Other opportunities are not level, but you have access to what I'm talking about.</p>

<blockquote>Morality now requires some learning (and probably not the learning you already have).</blockquote>
<p>Finding moral behaviour without principles can only rely on either understanding or trust.  Practically, the bar is much lower when access to the opportunity to learn is limited, but that is precisely what has changed a lot recently.  Combined with a time when trust, despite a world of good intention, is particularly fallible in most places, the connection between your learning and your morality has never been stronger.</p>

<p>Whatever you believe and whatever your walk of life, you want a more thorough and accurate worldview.  You want this in itself, and because it helps you make better decisions, understand your own natural authority and your relation to others, better meet your obligations to those others, and get the most out of your life.</p>

<h4 id="action">Action</h4>
<p>I'm signalling that this thoroughness is possible, and offering some of the parts currently missing.  I've committed to clarifying where we go wrong and how we fall short, and how we can go about developing our own understanding and employ it effectively in the world.  The development of understanding itself remains an individual journey where independence is a defining factor &ndash; you cannot simply rely on experts or me the whole way, with no one's ability and responsibility being tangibly different to yours &ndash; so I do not offer fully-constructed explanations of everything, and you should continue to look for mistakes and improvements in this writing as with any other.</p>

<blockquote>Time is of the essence.  Get used to taking responsibility for suffering.</blockquote>
<p>There is some urgency: because of the things you already know to be wrong with the world, since every day of delay can also be measured in pain and death; because we have limited time to make things right; and because through poor understanding we can make mistakes or lose battles that are irreversible.</p>

<p>Time, energy and attitude are the only remaining obstacles to you, and it's your first responsibility to fight for these and make the most of what you have of them, for the purpose of a better understanding that allows you to respond to other responsibilities effectively.  Thorough understanding doesn't take a lifetime to acquire and is available to almost anyone, but it doesn't come from your formal education or unexamined experience or any established specialism; the worst thing you can do is to stop too soon, either from overconfidence, from under-confident or jealous abnegation, or desperately grabbing for simplicity as the dominant principle to make all problems disappear.</p>

<p>Society looks very different after we do this.  This ignites both your responsibility and your positive incentive to produce something more than a little bit better, for yourself, me, and the next generation.</p>
