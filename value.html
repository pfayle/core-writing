<p>I am concerned with finding a small framework that can account for everything we find valuable, and helps us decide on their relative importances and how we should manage conflicts between them.  This is in some ways a simplification, and in other ways a refinement, of how our social rules came into being, and it supercedes hierarchical models of needs.</p>

<p>The core values are the result of an iterative process of introspection, deconstruction, and application against a wide range of perspectives on real world situations.  My scope intentionally excludes the mechanics of how this core came about and does not look for more explanatory theories bringing physical observations into conflict with mental introspection, but with mental introspection fully satisfied and physical observations not neglected, treats this core as the single source of shared human authority.</p>

<p>This is the complex part of a bigger model that deals with human ontology, "ontology" here covering a similar area as when people talk about spirituality, but connoting a mechanical rather than mystical focus.  This is not to deny the existence of the divine, but to show that recourse to it is not required in answering every deep question.</p>

<h4 id="core">Core values</h4>
<p>There are four core values, characterised by being the only values common to all of us (exceptions are considered later) that we're unable to dispute in their entirety, and constituting a basis for satisfaction with life.  These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personal values.</strong>  This says that the other core values are not quite sufficient, and we always need something else unrelated to them.  Specifying precisely what is a matter of individual discretion subject to the rest of the core.</li>
<li><strong>Animal needs.</strong>  This covers the basics of staying alive, hunger, absence of serious pain, and anything of physical origin that fails to distinguish humans from animals.</li>
<li><strong>Experience.</strong>  This says that we need to observe, which is a basis for choosing later values of enjoying interaction and exploration.  This reflects the difficulty of coping with extreme sensory deprivation and isolation, and creates a basis for boredom.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy.</strong>  This says that we recognise a deep similarity of experience in others and want the same core values satisfied for them, too.  Coupled with our reasoning and observational abilities, this directly generates our sense of responsibility.  Empathy concerns a valued feeling of connectedness; we do not recognise a more intense sense of love as so universal, and we do not imply that individual empathetic actions will be kind.</li>
</ol>

<p>The core is intended to be <strong>minimal,</strong> for the consequence that it applies to as many people as possible.  Any additional values and uncontrolled feelings you put on an equal footing with these values are actively creating distance and obstacles for others.  Great care is needed, because non-minimal cores have been instruments of oppression and atrocity, asserting some group of people to be fundamentally different, only to recant this later.  Where there might be a practical need to do this, minimality is an important quality to ask for.  Minimality tends to go hand in hand with abstraction.</p>

<p>When you think something has been omitted from the core, it is likely that the things you want most are the same things other people want most, but you express it too liberally, with tenets or implications that are unnecessary and unshared.  <strong>There is no provision in this core for necessary values that are unique to you.</strong>  Such values are accounted for as personal values and subject to the logical consequences of empathy, rather than commanding universal respect.</p>

<p>Belief is able to manipulate and change these core values, but the principles of major religions can be expressed from this core without conflict.  Beliefs that create distance from a minimal core and a sense of shared experience create societal threat.</p>

<h4 id="complexities">Basic complexities</h4>
<p>Personal values (1) and empathy (4) make the system self-referential, which is the main source of complexity and conflict.  4 also mandates attempting to extend the system logically, while 1 mandates arbitrary choices subject to the rest of the system.  That is already problematic &ndash; understanding the complete logical extension from 4 with high confidence is impossible, so any choice from 1 risks being shown to be incompatible: <strong>all choices of personal value are fundamentally vulnerable;</strong> it is impossible to find full assurance.</p>

<blockquote>When you examine the foundations of logic and therefore communication, you will be alone.</blockquote>

<p>It's tempting to observe that our reasoning abilities rely on logical tools which are all subject to challenge at a very fundamental level, and therefore we could make free choices from 1 with impunity.  The problem with that is that our deep similarity of experience carries with it an ability to communicate, that ability necessitating that we accept at least the most basic observations and logical tools (such as deduction; induction remains unwelcome at this point).  This is not a strict necessity, but as I am primarily concerned with <em>collective</em> mental journeys, and attempting to deconstruct communication and logic is not thought to be a reliably profitable group activity, probing such assumptions further will always be out of scope for this discussion.</p>

<h4>Life and meaning</h4>
<p>It's mainly empathy (4) that leads to protecting life in various circumstantial derived ways, but it's not entirely clear whether life is fundamentally valued in itself without applying 1 (personal values).  The answer is that the life of others <em>is</em> fundamentally valued, and it's tied up in empathy &ndash; the <em>existence</em> of an external deep similarity of experience is valued in itself, leading to a sense of loss of value and/or loss of potential with every human life.</p>

<blockquote>Satisfying our core values fulfils our need for meaning.</blockquote>
<p>Behind hard-to-clarify questions about meaning and purpose lies some need.  It will remain at least partly speculative while there is substantial suffering in the world, but one of my core theses is that these core values fully meet this need.  In particular, we struggle to fulfil empathy (4) with our current blend of freedom and suffering (and simply jettisoning our freedom by delegating carelessly to others also falls foul of our responsibilities under 4), and 1 (personal values) says that we need <em>something</em> that is <strong>value we have created from nothing,</strong> which is the thing you do automatically unless you're a dogmatic nihilist (which don't exist), but you may benefit from engaging with the value more deliberately, if not uniquely, to express personality.</p>

<h4 id="exploration">Exploration</h4>
<p>There isn't a fundamental need to explore, but it's a very difficult one to put down because it's strongly suggested by 4 (empathy), which even if the logic isn't quite there makes it an obvious candidate for personal values (1).  Exploration dually adds risk and a possibility of benefit, and if that benefit can help satisfy core values, then the exploration falls under empathy &ndash; see medical research and space travel, for example.  The urge to explore for its own sake can either be taken as an arbitrarily chosen value under 1, or under 4 as meeting some need of nature or the divine, such as appreciating an action or intention, that is somehow "aligned" or worthy of respect in sufficiently close analogy to human similarity.  Less welcoming attitudes to exploration can be explained by a different perception of the risks, perhaps combined with the idea that experience (3) is enough.</p>

<p>Exploration also covers logical exploration, carrying out experiments both in thought and deed to put ideas to the test, as an additional tool for extending our reasoning from 4.</p>

<p>Certainly there have always been people entirely happy not to explore at all, but in every society of any size, it has not been sustainable to assume that all members will be so content.  To what extent this would hold in a <strong>post-empathy world</strong> (i.e. when 4 is still felt but is satisfied) is an open question.</p>

<h4 id="society">Society</h4>
<p>We derive well-known, massive systems from 4 (empathy): both domains of knowledge and instutitions, such as economics, law, and government.  In their design and advancement, these make heavy use of scientific principles to select and explore ideas and build consensus based on probability (induction with numbers attached in a rough fashion), and in their actual operation, they use decision-making processes that have licence to depart from such a consensus.  While the accumulated successes of these systems are a vast testament to our historical efforts towards 4, there is more to do using the same and other approaches, before it is anywhere near satisfied.</p>

<h4 id="other-principles">Other principles</h4>
<p>While we can employ 1 (personal values) to support new values, we can't guarantee any consensus, which is why they are fundamentally personal values even when we form large communities based on them.  We can also blur the line between 1 and 4 (empathy) when we decide to adopt a principle despite not being content that the observations supporting it are rigorous, and that's typically what you see with divisive issues in public discourse.  This can occur as some entity either presuming to make an assumption on behalf of wider society, or posturing in some wider power-struggle.</p>

<p>In general, you can trust someone driven by strong, overt principles to behave predictably when it is clear how to apply them, but you can't trust them to handle complex issues or to give priority to your core values.  <strong>Both moral relativism and principle-based absolutism are methods to avoid the complexity inherent in logical systems,</strong> the uses of which are for taking decisions quickly, nullifying the importance of learning, and creating an easy basis for consensus.</p>

<h4 id="indulgence">Indulgence</h4>
<p>Despite the licence given for personal values, any appeal to human nature that goes beyond the core and its logically rigorous extensions is extremely unsafe.  The most common motivations to do this are giving too much weight to biologically-driven "sentimental" emotions &ndash; which do not generally fall under 2 (animal needs) &ndash; and a frustrated response to complexity looking for simplicity.  Consequences arising from either are liable to push the boundaries of empathetic responsibility (4).  It is still very common to find rhetoric targeting both motivations.  We intentionally subjugate generic animal drives to human needs precisely because our intuition requires it, though we also expect a high level of tolerance to indulgence where it is not clearly obstructive.</p>

<p>We have a strong collective habit of grouping together around principles on a right-or-wrong basis, and this takes the place of a group with a common interest asserting power for its own sake.  Perhaps through this habit, we are largely unaccustomed to asserting power and desires directly without a shared justification, and so we are incentivised to find principles to create one.  This self-indulgent impotence is now diametrically opposed to the moral choices required by our core values, and <strong>breaking our shame over overt power now appears to be appropriate and necessary.</strong>  Underlying structures of trust and friendship should find more solid foundations than an amalgam of weak principles.</p>

<p>A further manifestation of indulgence is to place a great portion of your sense of self-worth in your work.  There are several understandable motivations for this, one being that work can serve as a successful microcosm, the largest complex and comprehensible structure that reflects the world but functions satisfactorily.  However, whatever the work that you do, the way it operates and integrates with society is a primary component of the social structures that continue to oppress people, and the value you find in it is ultimately unable to compensate adequately for this.  Though it take up a large portion of your time and create great value for many, keep some detachment, reconcile yourself with the idea that it is a compromise you make continually, and don't neglect other types of value.</p>

<h4 id="exceptions">Exceptions and boundaries</h4>
<p>Empathy (4) rests entirely on the basis that we understand how the target of our empathy feels.  That's an easy enough assumption to live with concerning most people, but we have physical diseases and abnormalities to deal with &ndash; for example, how are we to consider people in the late stages of dementia, and people with no sense of empathy themselves?</p>

<p>Further complication lies with our treatment of animals.  The values above explicitly separate humans from animals, but anything important in the distinction would come from the values rather than other traits of humanity.  It's hypothetically more intuitive to treat an animal that exhibits all human characteristics as a human, but in practice it's easy to diminish their similarities as basic, far from the connection we have to other humans, and possibly little more than a similar physical response to pain and threat, which is why we don't give them equal empathetic consideration, which in turn becomes a distinct lower legal status and priority.</p>

<p>Empathy also carries some obligation to protect society, and an important component of organising such protection is to <strong>ensure that people involved in making decisions think and feel in a way you at least understand.</strong>  While a crucial part of the onus is on you to make sure you've done what you can to understand, extending the same extent of empathy to people who operate fundamentally differently undermines the obligation.  In some cases we can perhaps compromise effectively, such as by allowing sociopaths to participate fully and equally in society under a framework that promotes empathetic behaviour whether real or simulated, but in other cases it is prudent to be cautious in granting rights and protections on an equal basis by default.  The number of cases where such caution has mistakenly caused long-lasting resentment among similar people justifies doubling our efforts to understand, but not lowering our guard.</p>

<p>This domain is what is of fundamental interest when we look back at atrocious historical events.  We want to know either <strong>how well-intentioned behaviours led to an appalling outcome,</strong> or <strong>how poorly-intentioned individuals took control of a social system.</strong>  Hierarchical approaches to understanding need showed the idea that when not all core needs can be satisfied, we can see responsibilities and priorities degrade.  Whether we see the same patterns of degradation consistently across different people is doubtful, and there are many understandable ways to balance the four needs when constrained in different ways.</p>

<h4 id="outlook">Outlook</h4>
<p>Despite the vulnerabilities in foundational beliefs and intermediate choices, high levels of supportive consensus in complex domains are often quite easily achieved.  However, this does reflect a readiness to make unsafe logical jumps and a lack of retrospection, and that can result in strong divisions that take a long time to become properly understood or resolved.  Adding to this problem, the current fashion, which posits that people can successfully choose principles using <strong>intuitive feeling as an unchallenged authority,</strong> is a <strong>gross fundamental neglect of empathy</strong> and its consequences.</p>

<blockquote>Empathy requires you to consider people half the world away alongside your family.</blockquote>

<p>Despite our ubiquitous habit of doling out preferential treatment locally, there is nothing at this foundational level to suggest that familial, racial, or geographical proximity should influence value.  Empathy pulls this in both directions &ndash; strong local ties are often the foundation of a healthy life and society, and with very practical reasons around ease and effort and bolstered by our animalistic instincts, but the empathetic bond and responsibility go far beyond.  There is room to consider whether we might satisfy our needs better by looking further afield.</p>
