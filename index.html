<h3>Core writing</h3>
<p>My core writing is the intersection of what is important to me and what I want to communicate, including my life philosophy.  I write to express myself and make myself better known, and because I have something to say that carries moral force and can be more widely understood.</p>

<p>This writing can generally be expected to be maintained (here and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pfayle/core-writing">on GitHub</a>); that is, where I become aware of problems with the contents, I will invest time in attempting to resolve them, making changes where appropriate.</p>

<p>My other writing is ephemeral unless stated otherwise, where errors and carelessness may be allowed to persist unmaintained and remain available to the extent allowable by law and strategically expedient, and to convey personality, fallibility, progress, and how I apply my understanding to issues peripheral and tangential to the core.</p>

<p>This core text may all be adapted, amended, re-used and re-published freely without notification or attribution, and I particularly welcome attempts to adapt the tone and employ alternative or additional media and styles to reach specific audiences &ndash; please <a href="../../index.html#contact">contact me</a> if you would like to discuss this.<p>
